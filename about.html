        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I was always curious about how technology works, which led me to major in Computer Science. 
          As a student athlete playing football at Mount St. Joseph University, I’ve learned how to balance academics, sports, and personal growth. 
          I enjoy learning about data, problem solving, and building projects that improve my technical skills. 
          Outside of school and football, I like working out, snowboarding, and playing video games with friends.
